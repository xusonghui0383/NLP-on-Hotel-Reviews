# NLP-on-Hotel-Reviews
This project is to perform analysis of real hotel review data crawled from the
Tripadvisor website to automatically identify positive and negative keywords and phrases associated
with hotels and to better understand characteristics of data analysis tools, extract explanatory
review summaries, and human reviewing behavior.
